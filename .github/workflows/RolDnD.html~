				Savage weapons combine speed, weight and penetration, enabling them to deal decisive blows in combat. When you roll a 19 on an attack roll, roll an additional d6. If you roll the number given in parentheses next to the weapon, or higher, you score a critical hit. If the weapon has the versatile property reduce the number in the parentheses by 1, when it is wielded in two hands. If there is no number in parentheses, no need to roll a d6, a 19 is an automatic critical hit.

				<h2>SPECIAL AMMO</h2>
				<b>Every type of ammo can be made magical for 3 times the original price.</b>
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<b>Tracing Bullet.</b> The target takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns and cannot benefit from the effects of invisibility for 1 min. When the creature takes this damage it may make a Con save against your attack DC to end this effect prematurely.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Long Round.</b> When you hit a creature with this bullet you may make an additional attack against a creature within 5ft of the original one thats on a direct line from you, if this attack hits, that second creature takes damage equal to half the damage the original creature took.
				<br>
				
				<br>
				
				<b>Explosive Round.</b> Ignore the damage of the weapon and deal 1d8 fire damage to every creature within 5ft of the target including the target itself.
				<div id="contenido">
				<h2>SPECIAL PROPERTIES</h2>
					<b>Spread.</b> When you make an attack with this weapon within your "close" range, you may choose to forgo your normal attack to force all creatures in the area to make a Dexterity Saving Throw with a DC equal to your attack DC or receive the damage. This attack doesn't add your ability modifier to the damage. This type of attack counts as a melee attack for the purposes of flanking. Spread weapons cant use Explosive rounds.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Caliber.</b> When you score a critical hit with this weapon you deal an additional die of damage.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Misfire.</b> Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weaponâs Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinkerâs Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weaponâs misfire score by 1.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Reload.</b> The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.

				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Antitoxin.</b> Drinks this vial gives advantage on Saving Throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to Undead or constructs.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Keoghtom's Ointment.</b> The creature that receives it regains 2d8 + 2 hit points, ceases to be poisoned, and is cured of any disease.  Can be swallowed or applied to the skin.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Resistance.</b> When you drink this potion, you gain resistance to one type of damage for 1 hour. The DM chooses the type or determines it randomly.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Animal Friendship.</b> When you drink this potion, you can cast the Animal Friendship spell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Water Breathing.</b> You can breathe Underwater for 1 hour after drinking this potion. Its cloudy green fluid smells of the sea and has a jellyfish-like bubble floating in it.
				<br>
				<br>

				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Sovereign Glue.</b> This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two Objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with Oil of Slipperiness. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.
				<br>
				<br>
				One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of Universal Solvent or Oil of Etherealness, or with a wish spell.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Universal Solvent.</b> This tube holds milky liquid with a strong alcohol smell. You can use an action to pour the contents of the tube onto a surface within reach. The liquid instantly dissolves up to 1 square foot of adhesive it touches, including Sovereign Glue.

				<h2>ALCHEMIST'S SUPPLIES</h2>
				<b>Acid.</b> As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged Attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an Improvised Weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage. (range 20/60 , weight 1 lb.)
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Alchemist's Fire.</b> Same as Acid (above this) but 1d4 fire damage and it's a DEX save.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Climbing.</b> When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Philter of Love.</b> The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become Charmed by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are Charmed. This potion's rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Fire Breath.</b> After drinking this potion, you can use a bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour has passed. This potion's orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the top of the container and wafts out whenever it is opened.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Hill Giant Strength.</b> When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes to 21 for 1 hour. The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score. This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a hill giant.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Growth.</b> When you drink this potion, you gain the âenlargeâ effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potionâs liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Claravoyance.</b> When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the clairvoyance spell. An eyeball bobs in this yellowish liquid but vanishes when the potion is opened.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Diminution.</b> Same as Potion od Growth but "reduce" instead of "enlarge".
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Gaseous Form.</b> When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the gaseous form spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potionâs container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<h2></h2>
				<b>Potion of Heroism.</b> For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the bless spell (no concentration required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Invulnerability.</b> For 1 minute after you drink this potion, you have Resistance to all damage. The potion's syrupy liquid looks like liquefied iron.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Mind Reading.</b> When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13). The potionâs dense, purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink floating in it.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Fire Giant Strength.</b>  Same as Potion of Fill Giant Strength but 25 of Strenght. This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a fire giant.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Invisibility.</b> This potionâs container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become invisible for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Speed.</b> When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the haste spell for 1 minute (no concentration required). The potionâs yellow fluid is streaked with black and swirls on its own.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Flying.</b> When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If youâre in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft. This potionâs clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Cloud Giant Strength.</b>  Same as Potion of Fill Giant Strength but 27 of Strenght. This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a cloud giant.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Longevity.</b> When you drink this potion, your physical age is reduced by 1d6 + 6 years, to a minimum of 13 years. Each time you subsequently drink a potion of longevity, there is 10 percent cumulative chance that you instead age by 1d6 + 6 years. Suspended in this amber liquid are a scorpion's tail, an adder's fang, a dead spider, and a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Storm Giant Strength.</b>  Same as Potion of Fill Giant Strength but 29 of Strenght. This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a storm giant.

				<h2>POISONER'S KIT</h2>
				<b>Oil of Slipperiness.</b> This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment itâs wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.
				<br>
				<br>
				Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Dust of Disappearance.</b> Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become Invisible for 2d4 minutes. The Duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the Invisibility ends for that creature.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Dust of Dryness.</b> This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible.
				<br>
				<br>
				Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to Shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet's magic.
				<br>
				<br>
				An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Dust of Sneezing and Chocking.</b> It appears to be dust of disappearance, and an identify spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The lesser restoration spell can also end the effect on a creature.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potion of Poison.</b> This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a potion of healing or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An identify spell reveals its true nature. If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Assasin's Blood.</b> A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) poison damage and is Poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isnât Poisoned.

The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment itâs wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the etherealness spell for 1 hour.
				<br>
